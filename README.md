TikTok Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from TikTok to uncover key insights related to video content, specifically distinguishing between "claim" and "opinion" videos. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain an understanding of video engagement patterns, claim statuses, and various factors that impact video performance.

Objectives

Understand the dataset: Analyze the structure of the provided dataset and identify key variables related to video engagement and content categorization.
Explore key insights: Perform EDA to investigate correlations between claim status, engagement levels, and other variables.
Provide actionable insights: Summarize the findings and provide recommendations based on data-driven insights.
Dataset Description

The dataset contains 19,382 samples of TikTok videos with various metrics, including:

Video type (claim vs. opinion)
Engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, comments)
Author status (active, banned, under review)
The primary goal is to explore these variables and their relationships to video performance.

Key Questions Addressed

What percentage of the data is comprised of claims and what percentage is comprised of opinions?
Out of 19,382 samples, just over 50% (9,608 videos) are claims, while the remaining are opinion videos.
What factors correlate with a video's claim status?
Engagement levels show a strong correlation with claim status, with claim videos generally having higher engagement.
What factors correlate with a video's engagement level?
Claim status: Claim videos tend to have higher engagement than opinion videos.
Author status: Videos from banned authors show significantly higher engagement than those from active authors, with authors under review showing intermediate engagement levels.
Project Structure

The project is divided into the following parts:

Part 1: Data Import and Exploration
Import the dataset and inspect its structure, checking for missing values and data types.
Part 2: Data Cleaning
Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and transform variables where needed.
Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generate visualizations and insights about the dataset. Analyze claim status, author engagement, and other key factors.
Part 4: Insights and Recommendations
Summarize findings and provide actionable insights based on the analysis.
Technologies Used

Python:
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: To document and present the analysis.
Tableau: For creating detailed visualizations and dashboards.
Next Steps

Begin by reading in the dataset and conducting a preliminary exploration of the data.
Proceed to data cleaning and perform exploratory analysis to identify patterns and insights.
Conclude with a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, focusing on claim vs. opinion videos and engagement factors.
